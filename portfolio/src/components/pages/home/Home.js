          Hello! My name is Darryl Williams and I am a student in the Trilogy
          Bootcamp at the University of Washington.
          <br />
          <br />
          I joined the program because I am not satisfied in current career
          path. Currently I work for an insurance company, writing estimates on
          damaged cars. When I look at myself and my life, I feel that there is
          a lot more that I could be doing.
          <br />
          <br />
          My interest include: sports, music and games. When I say games that
          includes a little bit of video games, but mostly good old fashioned
          board games, cards or dominos. I am a great problem solver, and as I
          grow in craft the limits are endless.
          <br />
          <br />
          Me and my wife recently moved to Washington from California, but we
          are not set on staying. We will go wherever life takes us. Thank you
          for taking a look at my portfolio. I hope you like what you see.
          <br />
          <br />- Darryl Eugene Williams II
